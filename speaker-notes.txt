Accessbility
SpeechRecognition.lang: Sets the language of the recognition. Setting this is good practice, and therefore recommended.
SpeechRecognition.interimResults: Defines whether the speech recognition system should return interim results, or just final results. Final results are good enough for this simple demo.
SpeechRecognition.maxAlternatives: Sets the number of alternative potential matches that should be returned per result. This can sometimes be useful, say if a result is not completely clear and you want to display a list if alternatives for the user to choose the correct one from. But it is not needed for this simple demo, so we are just specifying one (which is actually the default anyway.)

Api modernization
- electron (node, chromium, native apis), JS framework that allows you to write desktop applications
- semver for contract
- callbacks to promises (using v8)
- Documentation, roadmapping
- Trade offs

Testing in production: ideas, experiences, limits, roadblocks
Why you need tests in production
- Testing in production can allow you to get direct feedback/errors instead of having customer indirect feedback
- Guarantee it works consistenly after release
- Automated Scheduled tests that runs after the release

Level of testing
- As indicated here, the pyramid shows from bottom to top: Unit, Integration, E2E. As you move up the pyramid the tests get slower to write/run and more expensive (in terms of time and resources) to run/maintain. It's meant to indicate that you should spend more of your time on unit tests due to these factors.
- Cucumberjs, Bdd scenarios

Cucumber is a tool for running automated tests written in plain language. Because they're written in plain language, they can be read by anyone on your team. Because they can be read by anyone, you can use them to help improve communication, collaboration and trust on your team.
- the more often you run tests, the faster you'll notice an issue. Slow downs are the trade off

Composing music with composed functions
Pure functions: Given the same arguments, it will return the same value. No side effects
- Immutability
- higher order functions

Partial Application: a technique to "pre-set" or "fix" some arguments of a function
Why? Forces breaking down problems into their smallest parts

Essential JavaScript debugging tools for the modern detective
- stepping, conditional breakpoints
- debugging in the IDE
- vs code extension Debugger for Chrome

Making things fast in a world of build tools
- inline the google fonts css into the html
- copy the font files to the server
We can make use of <link rel="preload"> tags to make sure all dependencies start loading the second we receive our HTML.

Prerendering
- Arguably the biggest improvements for FMP can be achieved by sending styled markup in your index.html
- similar to server side rendering

Code splitting
The mantra here is to statically import the modules that are critically needed at load time and dynamically load everything else

- Only 1 webpack expert
- Rollup easier to write plugins
- Write your own plugins Instead of wrangling with others

Web norms of the world
- differences between asian, european, NA websites (amtrak, rakuten example)
- Gmarket (korean site) using images for text, faster than fonts, always renders the same
- Localization !== translation
- Internet infrastructure, mobile is used more in asia, broadbrand
- Build software tailored to peoples needs

UI State Machine
- The very first step is to learn how to think in states, rather than transitions.
- We are thinking linearly and basically trying to cover all possible directions to the final result.
- One step leads to another, and quickly we would start branching our code
- Focusing instead on the applicationâ€™s various states would be a lot simpler.
- How many states do we have, and what are their possible inputs?

Algorithms
- data with relationships
- O(n*m) order of N * M (nested loop)
- The outer loop executes N times. Every time the outer loop executes, the inner loop executes M times.
- As a result, the statements in the inner loop execute a total of N * M times.
- index to get entries faster
